# GeneratorMonitor

Run simulate_data.py in the terminal first.  Then with a separate terminal navigate to backend and run manage.py runserver.  From there you can access the localhost:8000/admin/ to view the simulated metrics. Next is to build:
1. An API to expose the metrics for external use
2. Create a frontend dashboard for real-time visualization
3. Add anamoly detection to flag suspicious metrics.
4. Data persistence and management
5. Alerts and notifications
6. User management
